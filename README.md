# Prediction-of-Student-Depression-Using-Machine-Learning-K-Means-Clustering-
This project applies KMeans Clustering and PCA visualization on student mental health data to identify hidden patterns and behavioral groupings that may indicate varying levels of depression or stress.

This plot represents the result of KMeans clustering applied to a student mental health dataset. The original high-dimensional feature space was reduced to 2 dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for visualization.

ðŸ”´ Red Cluster (Cluster 0)
The red cluster represents a mixed group of students, with both depressed and non-depressed individuals. This suggests a moderate-risk category, where students might be facing some stress or imbalance. They donâ€™t show extreme behavior but still need observation and support.

ðŸ”µ Blue Cluster (Cluster 1)
The blue cluster mainly includes students without depression, indicating better mental health. These students likely maintain a healthy routine, experience lower stress levels, and have good academic-life balance. This group can serve as a reference for healthy behavior patterns.

ðŸŸ¢ Green Cluster (Cluster 2)
The green cluster has a higher concentration of students with depression. It reflects a high-risk group potentially struggling with stress, poor sleep, or low satisfaction. These students may benefit the most from early intervention and counseling support.
